      As part of our duty to find the most accurate and customized search results we do require information about our users (such as gender, age, hobbies etc.). However, this information will be used for matching purposes only and we will try our best to ensure that it remains private and safe unless asked for by government or legal authorities. We will try our best to ensure that no human rights are invaded (under the UK law) and every user has the freedom to decide which information to share or not share other than the mandatory details which include:

    <ul class="text">

      <li>Email Address</li>
      <li>Gender</li>
      <li>Nationality</li>
      <li>Birth Date</li>
      <li>Primary language of use</li>
